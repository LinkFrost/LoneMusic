This is the home page, which is the main feed of the site. Here is a social media like feed interface where new posts are loaded. Users can play the beat, see the top few comments, and interact with it by liking, disliking, sharing, or going to the comments section. The user can also sort the feed, from trending posts, latest posts, to posts by people that the user is following.
![](img/Beat.png)
This is a thread for a beat post. The top contains the information about the beat, similar to the feed, and under it is a toggle for either replying with a comment or song. Under that is the replies portion of the thread, which has two sorting categories: sorting replies by top/latest, or sorting between comments and songs. Then finally, there are the replies themselves, which have a like and dislike button next to each of them. There are nested replies as well (only one level).
![](img/Song.png)
This is a thread for a song reply. It's very similar to a beat thread page, and says which beat the song was recorded on. Here there is only the ability to comment, with the comment thread underneath.
![](img/Profile.png)
This is a user's profile page. It has their picture and name on the side, as well as a follow button, and filter buttons for what is on the main view: the users beats, vocals, comments, and things they have liked. These can all be sorted by top or latest.
![](img/Account.png)
This is the edit account page, where a user can update their name, email address, password, and profile picture.
![](img/Login.png)
The login/signup page, currently on the log in view. Logging in will be done via email addresses.
![](img/Signup.png)
The login/signup page, currently on the sign up view.
![](img/Upload.png)
This is the upload beat page, where the user can type in the beat title, choose the genre through tags, and upload a file. In the future this might be a modal instead of a page.
