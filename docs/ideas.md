### Innovative Idea

Lone Music is a platform where both creators and listeners alike can go to discover new music in a way never seen before. Most music is made up of instrumentals and vocals, combined with one another resulting in a single finalized sound. During the recording process, the instrumental (or beat) is usually made first and it is then up to the vocalist (or rapper) to add lyrics. Lone Music provides users with a new take on music, making it possible to hear many different versions of vocals over the same instrumental. As with most social medias, a ranking (or popularity) system will be in place allowing the instrumentals and vocals to be upvoted (liked) or downvoted (disliked).

Lone Music is inspired by BeatStars, SoundCloud and Kanye West's new "Stem Player". BeatStars is an online platform where people can go to purchase beats to use in their own music. SoundCloud is a popular site for both emerging and established artists to post their music. The "Stem Player" is a handheld device that allows users to control vocals, drums, bass and add effects, allowing for unique customizations of any song.

### Important Components

Our project will have a few primary functions, all centered around sharing and matching music creators. First, is simply a feed allowing musicians to share instrumentals. They can post their instrumental and see what friends/peers have to say about it. Each posting will have likes/dislikes (or upvotes/downvotes) and a section for commenting, ultimately cultivating a Social Media esque experience.

On top of the classic Social Media experience, each post will also have a collaboration section. This is where vocalists of all kinds, be it singers, rappers, voice-over specialists, etc., will be able to share their rendition of the posted piece. In one centralized area we will show the original musical piece, along with various renditions of it, allowing both the musician, and onlookers, to listen to various takes on their music.
