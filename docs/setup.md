1. Clone `https://github.com/joepetrillo/cs326-final-bullymaguire/`
2. In that folder, run `npm install`
3. Create a .env file and add a variable named "DATABASE_URL". This should contain the URL to a MongoDB database, as that is where all the user data will be stored. All collection creation is handled in the code.
4. After that, run `npm start`, and in your browser, go to "localhost:3000/" to use the website
5. To use the app in this release, you must first register an account on the signup page, and then log in with that user on the login page. This will allow you to access the rest of the website.
